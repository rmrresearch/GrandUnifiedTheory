# GrandUnifiedTheory

Notes on various theories with an emphasis on how they all fit together.

# Building the Notes

We recommend using Python's virtual environments and installing all dependencies
into the virtual environment. This is done by (assuming Python 3.3+):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can build the notes by running `cd docs; make html` and view them by
directing your browser to `docs/build/html/index.html`
